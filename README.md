This is the source code to go with my tutorial on using [RabbitMQ exchanges with PHP](http://blog.programster.org/rabbitmq-exchanges-with-php/).

To use the source code, you will need to perform a composer install/update to fetch the necessary packages. The packages were not included to prevent possible licensing issues.
